# CWH-Dashboard
This is a Power-BI project with the combination of python, in this project i just create a dynamic dashboard with the help of power-BI and python. 
This ia a analysis of a youtube channel name CodeWithHarry, in which i just use the youtube data to analyze and create a dynamic dashboard. For doing that I use the youtube API and Python to fetch the data from youtube of CodeWithHarry, and then by the help of pyhton i just create a xlsx dataset by performing some cleaning tasks.
After that with the help of Power-BI i just create the dasboard that show some insights that are given above.
